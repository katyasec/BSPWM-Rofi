# üå∏ Semi-complete rofi .config! [for BSPWM] üå∏

This project isn't really much of a project but more of a run-down on my rofi setup and all of my config files inside bspwm/ and rofi/ that all suit the needs of rofi.
I hope you peeps enjoy this as it took me 2 days to curate.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER! ‚ö†Ô∏è
The 'Color' category is out-dated as i am adding more to it and hopefully coding a way to automate the process of the .sh files everytime you make a dir for a new theme and add a new wallpaper in the wall/ dir of the theme dir. The Game Launcher is also still in-development, basics are done, just need to add extra emulators and add their functionality.

# HOW TO USE / INSTALL!

```
git clone [URL]
cd BSPWM-Rofi
cp rofi ~/.config
cp bin ~/.config/bspwm (this can be anywhere or edited to your preference)
```

After cloning the directory and copying all of the folders to their designated places, please edit the files to change the outputs of some of the scripts in bin/ and if you need further editing, yeah... do it yourself! :3
